# Music Order Program

I wrote this program back when I went to AW Beattie Career Center. This is the technical school were I learned to program, startin in Java. 
The school is still there as I am typing this, but the Advanced Computer Programming (ACP) class is no longer there. It ended when Dr. Bob
Costiloe retired. This school has a special place in my heart and this program will help demonstrate on what I've learned.
